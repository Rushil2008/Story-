caught it in his hand and the mouse got really scared and requested the lion not to eat so that he can help him one or the other day .
So after many requests of the mouse the lion left him and he made a lot of fun of the mouse what will you help me you are so tiny .
After few days and the lion was walking in got into the trap of the hunter and started roaring and then the mouse heard it and took it's friend to the place and started bitting 
the net to  and the lion got free and the lion thanked him .
